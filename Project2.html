                <li>Iterating on designs</li>
                        
        </ul>
            
        </p>
        
        <h2>Project Goal</h2>
        
        <p>Design a website for the store that will allow users to search for grocery items from the comfort of their home, allow users to pickup order from store or have it delivered to their door step at their convenienece.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    
        <p>
        Busy workers, commuters and disabled people have trouble finding time for grocery shopping or are unable to travel to the store, also notify customer on special deals ands promotions
        
        </p>
        
        <h2>Key challenges or constraints</h2>
        
        <p>
            My key challenges were the budget and the short time frame to complete the work, but fortunately I was able to make it.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Research study details</h2>

        <p>I started the project with a simple survey to find out public opinion on online grocery shopping, the data from the survey allowed me to create personas that helped me to better understand user needs and increase empathy.</p>
    
        <h2>Initial design concepts</h2>

        <img src="./assets/Paper wireframes for coffeehouse app.jpg" alt="">
    
        <p>Taking time to generate these paper
        wireframes allowed me to organize my
        thoughts, these simple wireframes
        provided me a direction to follow when
        designing digital wirframes, also this
        method saved time and money
        on producing slightly more complex
        digital wireframes which tend to be a
        more demanding task.</p>
